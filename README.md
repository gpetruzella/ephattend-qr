# Canvas QR Code Generator

A minimalist bookmarklet that extracts student data directly from Canvas People pages and generates print-ready QR codes. Great for creating student QR codes for attendance tracking, lab access, or any application requiring unique student identification. Perfect companion to **EphAttend**, the local, privacy-respecting PWA.

## ‚ú® Features

2. **Student detection**: Uses multiple CSS selectors to find student data
3. **Data extraction**: Parses student names and Canvas user IDs
4. **QR generation**: Creates QR codes using external API service
5. **PDF creation**: Formats QR codes in print-ready grid layout

### Canvas Compatibility
Tested and working with:
- **Modern Canvas interface** (2023+)
- **Classic Canvas interface** 
- **Various institutional Canvas customizations**
- **Different Canvas course layouts**

### Security Approach
- **CORB-resistant**: Self-contained script bypasses Cross-Origin restrictions
- **Local processing**: All data processing happens in your browser
- **No external dependencies**: Minimal external API usage (QR image generation only)
- **Privacy-first**: Student data never leaves your device

## üìã Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Canvas course access** with student roster
- **Desktop browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Pop-up permissions** enabled for Canvas domain

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Access Canvas**: Navigate to your course's People page
2. **Load students**: Scroll down to ensure **all** students are visibly loaded (Canvas lazy-loads)
3. **Run bookmarklet**: Click the bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar
4. **Verify extraction**: Review the list of found students
5. **Generate QR codes**: Click "Generate & Print" button
6. **Print or save**: Use browser's print dialog to save as PDF or print directly

### PDF Output Details
- **Layout**: 2 columns √ó 6 rows per page (12 QR codes per page)
- **Content**: Each QR code contains "Student Name (Canvas ID)"
- **Format**: Student name and ID printed below each QR code
- **Multi-page**: Automatically flows to additional pages for large courses
- **Print-ready**: Optimized margins and sizing for standard paper

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Bookmarklet Installation Issues
**Code displays instead of button:**
- Use the manual bookmark creation method
- Copy the JavaScript code and create bookmark manually
- Ensure you're viewing the deployed page, not local file

**Bookmarklet doesn't appear in bookmarks:**
- Try right-clicking and "Add to bookmarks" instead of dragging
- Check that bookmarks bar is visible in browser
- Use keyboard shortcut to show bookmarks bar

### Canvas Detection Issues
**No students found:**
- Ensure you're on the Canvas **People** page (not Grades/Modules)
- Scroll down to load all students (Canvas uses lazy loading)
- Try switching to "All" or "Students" view if available
- Refresh the Canvas page and try again
- Check browser console for error messages

**Wrong data extracted:**
- Verify you're in the correct Canvas course
- Make sure you have appropriate permissions to view student list
- Check that Canvas course has enrolled students

### QR Generation Issues
**Print window doesn't open:**
- Check that pop-ups are allowed for Canvas domain
- Try running on Chrome or Firefox (best compatibility)
- Disable browser ad-blockers temporarily

**QR codes don't display:**
- Ensure stable internet connection (for QR image generation)
- Try again after a few moments
- Check browser developer tools for network errors

**Print formatting issues:**
- Use browser's print preview to verify layout
- Adjust print margins if needed
- Try "Print to PDF" option for best results

## üîó Integration

### Companion Projects
This QR generator pairs perfectly with:
- **QR Attendance Scanners**: Use generated codes for classroom attendance
